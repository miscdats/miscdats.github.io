          <h3>Available for freelance work, as well.</h3>
          <p>My most recent experience was at SAP Concur as a Software Design Engineer 
            Intern. It was so invigorating I stayed a little longer than planned, before 
            returning to see myself through the finish line of my student career. 
            I worked in Golang and Java, developing a solution for big data migrations, 
            among other projects, and gained invaluable knowledge in code ownership 
            and agile workflow with a fantastic team.
          </p>
          <p>Prior, I was part of a team of students working to gain experience practically.
            We had short term contracts with clients, developing different apps and services.
            My work has involved database design and serverless APIs, cloud infrastructure
            and cybersecurity.
          </p>
          <p>In the past, I have created and deployed Python scripts, automating
            secure data input in real-time, saving hundreds of employee hours.
            Presented research and proof of concept in migrating databases from
            legacy; then launching custom scripts and ensuring future-proofing.
          </p>
          <p>I have a background in psychology and incorporate that in
          my designs, facilitating the connection between user and technology while
          using effective communications in documentation.</p>
          <p>Languages I'm comfortable in: Java, Python, Golang, and JavaScript.</p>
          <p>Educational focuses: Web application development,
            Data structures and algorithms, Database technology, Cloud development...</p>

          <h1>About me</h1>
          <h2>Based in Seattle, WA.</h2>
          <p> I am originally from Miami, FL; surviving the heat used to
            be my primary goal. Now I am the heat!</p>
          <p> I've always had a passion for improving things. I seek out
            what needs doing and enjoy the process as much as the result.
            My skills are broad, ranging from design to ux and working front
            end to back end for big data pipelines.</p>
          <p> Each day, I learn something new and can't wait to put it to good
            use! If you would like to build something together,
            <a href="mailto:deyanira@taupier.dev">reach out</a>~*</p>
          <p>Recently, I graduated from North Seattle College with a Bachelor's of 
            Applied Science in Application Development.
            Much like Computer Science, I spent time learning data structures and
            algorithms, what to do with Big Data, but spent months with hands on
            experience in practicum with clients. This exposed me to
            different technologies but also real time experience in handling
            leadership roles and taking initiative, which I now feel help me be
            a better developer. </p>
          <p>As a nerd, I find it fun to play around with home networking and 
            programming useless devices and Raspberry Pi-ing things just because 
            it is nice to hear my mechanical keyboard in action.
          </p>
            <br>
          <p>On my off time, my puppy
            <a href="images/bongo.jpg" data-lightbox="Cuties"
            data-title="My pup!">Bongo</a> and I go frolic into the wilds. 
              Sometimes, I'm engaging with my music, playing bass guitar. 
              I also can cream anyone at Super Smash Bros, so watch out.</p>
